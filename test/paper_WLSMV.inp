MODEL:
!LABELING FACTOR LOADINGS FOR B1-B20 RELATING THEM TO FACTOR F 
            F BY I1-I20* (L1-L20);

!LABELING FACTOR VARIANCE AND MEAN, RESPECTIVELY
            F* (FVAR); 
            [F] (FMEAN); 

!LABELING THREE THRESHOLDS (#CATEGORIES-1) PER ITEM
        [I1$1-I20$1] (T1I1-T1I20); !THRESHOLD 1 FOR ITEMS 1-20
        [I1$2-I20$2] (T2I1-T2I20); !THRESHOLD 2 FOR ITEMS 1-20
        [I1$3-I20$3] (T3I1-T3I20); !THRESHOLD 3 FOR ITEMS 1-20
         
!USING MODEL CONSTRAINT TO CALCULATE IRT PARAMETERS
MODEL CONSTRAINT: 

!SETTING FACTOR VARIANCE AND FACTOR MEAN TO 1 AND ZERO, RESPECTIVELY

!D1I1-D1I20, D2I1-D2I20, AND D3I1-D3I20 ARE DIFFICULTIES
!DIFFICULTIES CALCULATED USING EQUATION 8 WITH THE DO LOOP 
!FOR ITEMS 1-20, REPLACE # WITH RESPECTIVE ITEM #
